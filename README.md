# [RepoDb](http://repodb.net) - a hybrid ORM Library for .NET.

RepoDb is an open-source .NET ORM that bridge the gaps between micro-ORMs and full-ORMs. It helps the developer to simplify the switch-over of when to use the BASIC and ADVANCE operations during the development.

It is the best alternative ORM to both Dapper and EntityFramework.

<details>
<summary><b>The benefits of using this library</b></summary>

- The development experience is like Dapper but the feature is almost like EntityFramework.
- The installation is easy and fast, it can then be used right-away.
- The layer of like DbContext has been eliminated, those give the developers more control on the implementation.
- The calls to fluent and raw-SQL methods is just a dot away.
- The implementation of repository is becoming more simple by leveraging the built-in repositories.
- The control to query optimizations is easy via hints.
- The processes to handle the large datasets is very-simple with batch and bulk operations.
- The round-trips to the database is being minimized with 2nd-Layer cache.
- The column transformation can be customized with property handlers.
- The auditing and tracing is much more simpler using the trace capability.
- The support to dynamics is rich and can even work without the models.
- The transmission of the data from different RDBMS data providers only take few lines of codes.

### It is easy-to-use

RepoDb operations were implemented as extended methods of the IDbConnection object. For as long the connection is open, the developers can do all the activities towards the database.

### It is high-performant

RepoDb has its own compiler and pre-caches the already-generated compiled expressions for future reusabilities. It understands your schema to create the most optimal compiled expression AOT.

### It is efficient

RepoDb extracts and caches the object properties, execution contexts, object mappings and SQL statements. It is reusing them all throughout the process of transformations and executions.

### It is high-quality

RepoDb is a high-quality micro-ORM supported by 8K+ real-life Unit and Integration Tests. It is highly tested by various critical systems that is running in production environment.
